This contains my solutions to the Programming and Scripting 2019 Problem Set.

## Prerequisites

This code was created in MS Visual Studio Code v1.32.3 using Python 3.7.1.
You will need to have Python 3.7.1 (or higher) installed to run these programmes.

Some of the programmes require the following libraries:
* datetime
* sys
* numpy
* matplotlib

The Anaconda Distribution is recommended. It can be downloaded from [here] (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

## Problems

1. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the
sum of all numbers between one and that number.

2. Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the
letter T. An example of running this program on a Thursday is as follows.

3. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible
by 6 but not 12.

4. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the
successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value
by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply
it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

5. Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user
whether or not the number is a prime.

6. Write a program that takes a user input string and outputs every second word.

7. Write a program that that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs
an approximation of its square root.

8. Write a program that outputs today’s date and time in the format ”Monday, January
10th 2019 at 1:15pm”.

9. Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line. The program
should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

10. Write a program that displays a plot of the functions x, x2 and 2x in the range [0, 4].
